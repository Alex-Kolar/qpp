C++11 quantum computing library

Work in progress, contact me at vgheorgh@gmail.com for more details.

If anyone else is interesting in contributing please let me known. There is still a lot of work left to be done, and I can provide you with more details about what I have in mind. You need to have a decent knowledge of C++ (including templates) and some experience with Eigen linear algebra library (although this is not mandatory, but it is highly desirable)
