Version 0.1 - 21 December 2014
    - First stable version, public release

Version 0.2 - 26 January 2015
    - Minor fixes
    - Added prime-number related functions in <number_theory.h>:
        qpp::factors() - prime factors of positive integer
        qpp::isprime() - primality test

Version 0.3 - 15 February 2015
    - Added qpp::internal::Singleton<T>::get_thread_local_instance()

Version 0.4 - 8 March 2015
    - Added noexcept specification where suitable
    - Added the following exception types to the qpp::Exception::Type strong
        enumeration: NOT_QUBIT_MATRIX (replaces previous NOT_QUBIT_GATE),
        NOT_QUBIT_CVECTOR, NOT_QUBIT_RVECTOR and NOT_QUBIT_VECTOR
    - Added overloads of qpp::ptrace1(), qpp::ptrace2(), qpp::ptrace() and
        qpp::ptranspose() that allow a pure state input, as it was the case
        before with qpp::syspermute().
    - Added overloads of qpp::prod() and qpp::sum() for STL-like containers
    - Added new functions in <functions.h>:
        qpp::complement() - computes the complement of a subsystem vector
        qpp::rho2bloch() - qubit density matrix to Bloch vector
        qpp::rho2bloch - Bloch vector to qubit density matrix
    - Added new functions in <instruments.h>:
        qpp::measure_seq() - measures subsystems sequentially
    - Removed support for the C-style random number engine, as it is not thread
        safe. Hence, Eigen::Matrix::Random() should not be used, use instead
        qpp::rand() functions.
